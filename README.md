## Welcome!

I've created this portfolio to express my interest as an aspiring game developer with hopes to show my creativity -  willingness to learn and challenge new concepts and ideas as I journey towards my goal of working in the industry.

I am eager to apply my academic background, programming skills, and passion for video games to contribute to the leading success of games design and development; by pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling and creating groundbreaking gaming experiences.

During my studies, I gained a solid foundation in software development, problem-solving, and algorithm design, with a focus on Java, C++, C#, and Unity3D, all of which are critical in the game development process. I've completed several projects, during my studies and in my own personal time including:
- An EPQ exploring the different styles and best approaches to games design, leading me to design a game based off my research and analysed the results I obtained from my focus group. This was the first ever game design project I undertook during my final year of further education before going to university.
- Training AI, in a line racing problem, to traverse the best possible path within a space without colliding with any foreign objects or itself. This was my final project in university and what I wrote my dessertation on.
- SpaceShooter2D as the name suggest is a 2D space shooter game which I completed outside of my studies using the knowledge I learned in classes and following the detailed ultimate guide to game development in unity course on udemy.
- PacMan3D is a project I originally started in university as one of my assignments to develop a 3D game in unity. Upon my completion of the unity course I have since improved the game quality, really bringing the world of 3D PacMan to life.
- Unreal Engine projects still in progress.

All of these experiences have helped me hone my ability to write clean, efficient code as a developer, yet equally appreciate the art of the design process from the initial spark of inspiration to feeding the imagination, creating compelling experiences through interactive, engaging gameplay. I am excited by the prospect of working with talented individuals who share my passion and I hope my work captivates my dedication to step into the thrilling world of this industry.
