When I first began working on my project, I found it easier to plot out my task according to the key dates during the project and managed to space out the work I did well during those periods. However, as the further I got into the project the more difficult I felt it was becoming to keep a steady plan as I ran into various obstacles mainly with programming my algorithm. For future projects I believe I can improve my project management if I evaluate the tasks that I can do while Iâ€™m stuck on an issue instead of stressing over the one issue and losing out on time to do other tasks.
