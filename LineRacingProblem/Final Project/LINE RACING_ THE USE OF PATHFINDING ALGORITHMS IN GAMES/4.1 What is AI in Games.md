### What is AI in Games?

Artificial intelligence is defined as making it possible for computers to perform the thinking tasks that humans and animals are capable of by Ian Millington Et al.[^1]  So in the case of games, we can take this definition and say that AI is about computers being capable of making the decisions that a player could make. When modelling AI in games, the tasks that need to be processed can be split into three levels: movement, decision making and strategy. Movement refers to algorithms that turn decisions into some kind of motion; decision making involves a character working out what to do next; and strategy refers to an overall approach used by a group of characters (algorithms that don’t control just one character but influence the behavior of a whole set of characters (Figure 1).[^2]  Not all games will make use of all three levels, for example, board games such as chess only require an algorithm that implements strategy, whereas many games require no strategy at all such as open world games like Minecraft. As stated earlier, in this report my focus is understanding the algorithms which power the decision making of AI in games.
