# Acknowledgements

I would like to first of all give thanks to my friends and family who have supported me on this journey, it hasn’t been an easy one, there are always ups and downs but the years I’ve spent studying and making new friends have been full of excitement. I would also like to give a big thank you to my project supervisor Ana who was extremely supportive during my project, although due to certain circumstances I began my project late, she helped me get on track from start to finish and I wouldn’t have been able to complete this project without her.
