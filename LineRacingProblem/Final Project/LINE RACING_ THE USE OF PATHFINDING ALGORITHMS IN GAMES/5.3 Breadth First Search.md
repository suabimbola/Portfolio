### Breadth First Search

The breadth-first search algorithm can be used to determine the shortest path in unweighted graphs. As the name BFS  suggests, you are required to traverse the graph breadthwise (Figure 6).[^16] It works by starting from a source node (root node) and then traverses the graph exploring all neighbouring nodes at the current depth which are child nodes of the source before moving on to the next depth. This algorithm also makes use of queues to keep track of any child nodes that may have been encountered but haven’t yet been explored which helps avoid processing the same node more than once.

Pseudo Code:[^17]
```
Bfs(Graph, start_node, end_node)
{
	Create Empty List VISITED
	Create Empty List QUEUE
	VISITED.add(start_node)
	QUEUE.enqueue(start_node)
	current = start_node
	while current != end_node
	If v not in VISITED
        current = QUEUE.dequeue()
        for all neighbours n of current in Graph
        if n not in VISITED
		    QUEUE.enqueue(n)
        end for
        VISITED.add(current)
	end if
	end while
}
```

Limitations:
Breadth first search requires the use of extra memory to save the nodes that have been explored at each depth which can easily exhaust the available memory in low memory systems. Additionally in the worst-case scenario every vertex and every edge will be explored so the time consumed by the algorithm is directly proportional to the distance between the goal node and the root node. This can be expressed as O(V + E) when adjacency list is used and O(V^2) when adjacency matrix is used, where V stands for vertices and E stands for edges.
