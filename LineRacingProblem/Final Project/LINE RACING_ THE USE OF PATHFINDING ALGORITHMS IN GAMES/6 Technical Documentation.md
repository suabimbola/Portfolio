The line racing problem is a grid-based challenge where two programs battle against each other. The aim of the game is to move into empty cells while trying to trap your opponent. This problem when proposed from a game theory point of view can be represented as a two-player zero sum game, therefore the most suitable algorithm to use to tackle this problem is the minimax algorithm which makes decisions on moves based on the payoff to the player assuming that each player is trying to win.
