### Directed Weighted Graphs

Weighted graphs are in general sufficient to represent a game level, however, majority of pathfinding algorithms use a denser type of graph in the form of the directed weighted graph. As stated earlier, directed graphs imply that all the edges in the graph follow some direction This can be useful in many situations as we can’t always assume that if we can get from A to B, that we can also get from B to A (Figure 5).[^14] Furthermore, having multiple connections in different directions expanding from one node means that there can be different costs for different states in the game, for example the time it takes to swim through a river vs cross over a bridge.

An important model which inspires graph theory is the path. A path is defined as any route that can be traversed along the edges of a graph. A path may follow a single edge directly between two vertices, or it may follow multiple edges through multiple vertices.  The shortest path problem, when applied to graphs in this sense, consists of determining the paths between two vertices in a graph that minimize the sum of the cost of traversing each edge.
