### Game Features

- The game grid has a 30 by 20 cells width and height. Each player starts at a random location on the grid.
- The light cycle moves in straight lines and only turn in 90Â° angles while leaving a solid light ribbon in its wake.
- Each cycle and associated ribbon feature a different colour.
- Should a light cycle stop, hit a light ribbon, or goes off the game grid it will be instantly deactivated.
- Once the inputs have been read for the current game turn, your AI must provide its next move information on the standard output. 
- The output for a game turn must be a single line stating the next direction of the light cycle: either UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT.
- The last cycle in play wins the game. Does this count.
