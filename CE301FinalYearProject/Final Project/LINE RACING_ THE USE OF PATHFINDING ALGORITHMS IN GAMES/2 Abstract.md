# Abstract

The aim of my project was to learn about methods used to develop AI  agents in games then apply that knowledge to solve the line racing problem proposed on Codingame.com. The game is played against two programs on a grid – On each players turn they decide which direction to move; if their decision isn't made fast enough, is an incorrect move, leads off the grid or into an occupied cell, you lose. The game continues until one player is left.

This report provides an in-depth review of several strategies – used to power AI in games – which make it possible for them to play against humans and explains how they work using real game examples. I also demonstrate my own algorithm and comment on its effectiveness and improvements that could be made.
