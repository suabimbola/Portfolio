### Weighted Graphs

Weighted graphs consist of nodes and edges just like any other graph; however, they additionally have a numerical value associated with the edges. In mathematical graph theory this is called the weight, and in game applications it is more commonly called the cost (although the graph is still called a “weighted graph” rather than a “costed graph”) (Figure 4).[^13] It’s good to make distinctions between the use of graphs in mathematical graph theory vs its use in games. For example, mathematical graph theory has no issue with using negative weights in its calculations, except this isn’t the case when it’s used in games, simply for the fact that it doesn’t make sense to have a negative cost, and how do you compute a negative time to reach a destination? Algorithms like Dijkstra and A* search especially should only be used with non-negative weights as in most cases it will run into a loop as it can’t find a solution, technically speaking, one doesn’t exist.
