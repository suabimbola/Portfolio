### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra’s algorithm is name after Edsger Dijkstra the mathematician who formulated it. Its an algorithm which was originally designed to solve the shortest path problem. The algorithm is devised in a way that given point A find the shortest path to all other points, and in turn the solution to this algorithm will also include a solution to the pathfinding problem in games.

Limitations:
The main weakness of Dijkstra’s algorithm is in relation to its use as a pathfinding technique. Since it searches the entire graph to find the shortest route possible (as it was originally designed) it’s not very efficient for point-to-point pathfinding. This is further emphasized by Abdul Rafiq Et al. who compliment how although the algorithm is easy to implement and understand, its not the best method to solve pathfinding problems.[^19]
